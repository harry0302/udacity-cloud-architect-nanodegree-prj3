Text file identifying 2 poor security practices with justification.

# Poor practice 1
In the configuration of c3-app.yml, InstanceRole have full access to any s3 bucket instance. 
Roles should only have access to specific buckets and allow only necessary actions.

# Poor practice 2
Both public and private subnet network ACL rules allow all traffic on all ports from all ports. 
Network ACL rules should be used to minimize the available network connectivity to reduce the 
traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet.

# Poor practice 3
S3 buckets, including the bucket for VPC flow logs, have no server-side encryption and 
all the buckets have block public access disabled. The vpc-flow-logs can contain information 
that an attacker can use to compromise the system if the rest of the infraestructure is not set up correctly.
S3 buckets should be enable server-side encryption to prevent people who shouldn't have access to the content to
view the content.
