1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.
- Update security group to block SSH connections from any IP in the Internet.
- Allow login only with key files.


2. Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
- Enable least privillege access to S3 content by updating InstanceRolePolicy-C3 to allow access only to S3BucketRecipesFree.
- Enable encryption through KMS for data at rest to the content of S3 buckets which allows only specific subnets to access the content.
